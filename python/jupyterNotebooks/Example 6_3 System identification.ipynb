    "# Example 6-3: System identification\n",
    "\n",
    "This example considers identification of modal properties using measured response data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As engineers working with dynamics, it is very important to have a good overview of modal properties in the problem you are working with. The modal properties are traditionally defined as the solution of the eigenvalue problem $ [-\\omega^2 \\mathbf{M}+\\mathbf{K} ] \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$. This requires that the mass and stiffness matrices are available, for instance from a finite element model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are working with existing structures, it is also possible to estimate the actual modal properties from measurements of structural responses. For instance, the natural frequency is \"hidden\" in the response as a periodic behavior. To measure the dynamic response, a variety of alternatives is available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accelerometers**: this is the most common altenative. These sensors are cheap ande easy to install.\n",
    "- **Strain gauges**: are cheap, but installation requires access to the raw metallic surface of the structural component.\n",
    "- **GPS/GNSS**: this alternative is only feasible for structures with large motions, since the accuracy is in the order of cm/mm.\n",
    "- **Laser**: measures displacements between the sensor and a reflecive target. Requires a fixed point for the sensor, and a short distance to the target.\n",
    "- **Video**: it is possible to film the structure and track its motion frame-by-frame. This is very computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do measurements when we have computer models and fancy software? There are many reasons one wishes to perform modal identification or system identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data-driven models**: The system (structure) is complicated, and models accurately reflecting real structure are too demanding to develop. We can instead estimate models from the measurement data.\n",
    "- **Model uncertainties**: Model and parameter uncertainties are present, meaning the engineer do not fully know how to model the structure with high precision. For instance, values for some structural parameters are unknown, exact boundary contitions are unknown (spring supported or simply supported?), joint behavior is unknown (fixed, hinged, or something inbetween?), non-structural masses are unknown. \n",
    "- **Model updating/calibration**: The modal information can be used to calibrate system parameters. For instance, the tension in a cable can be estimated if the natural frequencies of the cable are measured.\n",
    "- **Damping identification**: Whereas mass and stiffness of materials are usually linked to well-known physics (beam theory), damping is a complex phenomenon that is not easy to predict.\n",
    "- **Modal tracking**: To track the modal properties over a long time period (weeks, months, years,...). Any changes over time could indicate evolving damage, or other unwanted developments in the structure.\n",
    "- **Model verification**: Verification of a computer model of the structure, or verifying that the structure behaves as intended in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest method to determine natural frequencies and damping ratios is to consider time histories of free vibration (i.e., give the structure a small force impulse and let the response decay to zero). However, this is rarely possible outside laboratory experiments since: \n",
    "- **Multi-modal behavior**: It is not easy to isolate the motion to only one specific mode at a time.\n",
    "- **Operational conditions**: Structures in-situ (buildings, towers, bridges, ...) can rarely be controlled. They are naturally not in free vibration but continuously excited by so-called ambient excitation (traffic, wind, human loading, ... ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two methods presented in the following are based on estimated spectra of dynamic responses, so we will generally assume that the response is a stationary stochastic process."

One should be careful since some peaks could indicate not a natural frequency but a distinct harmonic component in the loading, e.g. a rotating machinery. It is also neccessary that the modes are excited sufficiently so that their contribution is visible in the spectrum. The number of modes contributing to the response could range from 1 to 100, and highly depends on the structure and its type of loading.\n",
