    "In this problem, we will consider a single degree of freedom dynamic system with a mass of 100 kg, a natural frequency of 1 Hz and a damping ratio of 5%. The system is subjected to a zero mean stochastic dynamic load with a constant spectral density $S_x(\\omega)=10^3$ \n",

    "a) Obtain the auto spectral density of the response by calculating the response in the frequency domain using the power spectral density method. Calculate the standard deviation of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Make a python code that generates realizations of the load by Monte Carlo simulations. Calculate the dynamic response of the system using Newmark's method. How long time series should we consider to obtain reasonable estimates of the standard deviation of the response?\n",

    "c) Make a python code that estimates the auto-spectral density of the response from the times series and present results considering the average of 10 response time series 600 seconds long. \n",

    "d) Compare the auto-spectral density from the time and frequency domains and comment on any discrepancies you observe.\n"
