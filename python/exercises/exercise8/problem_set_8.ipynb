    "### Problem 1) Buffeting response of long-span bridges - single mode approximation\n",
    "*In this task, the objective is to obtain the response spectrum due to buffeting loads. The considered structure is  the Hardanger Bridge, which is modelled by a line-like beam representation of the box girder. The dynamic response is simplified to only consider loads from the turbulence component in the vertical direction $w(t)$, and the system is truncated to only include the first vertical mode $\\phi(x)$*.\n",
