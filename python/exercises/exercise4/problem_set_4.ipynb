    "In this problem, we will consider the glulam truss displayed below. The truss carries the roof of an industrial building, and there is production equipment used in the factory that is hanging down from the truss introducing a stochastic dynamic excitation. In this problem, we will asses the vibrations and the load effects caused by the two stochastic loads\n",

Assume a density of the material of $\\rho=2000 k/m^3$. The density is higher than the glulaminated timber since we have included mass from structural components that do not provide stiffness to the truss (the roof, secondary beams that supports the roof, and other installations)  \n",
